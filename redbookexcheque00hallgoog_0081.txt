three classes oi this anglo-French glosecry preserved in
numerous MSS. from the twellth to the fifleenth century,
aa well as in certain later transcripte, but it cannot be
clearly proved what the origin or precise object of this ἒῐθῑϊῑζῆζ
persistent type of exposition may have been. Modern §inpiis
antiquarians are pretty well agreed that it was intended ‘³⁰¹¹-
to elucidata the archaisms oecurring in Anglo-Norman
charters3 but contemporary scribes seem to have been ’
almost equally divided in opinion on this subject, some
aseribing the motiva of the compilation tc the necessity
of expounding teehniealities of the Saxon lawe,1 and
others to the like intention in connection with the terme
employed in early charters. Thus the St Panl's MS.
mentions, in the original title, the former explanation,
while a nearly contemporary note refers to the clucida-
-tion of certain charters

In fact, however, many of the registers in which
thie glossary occurs eontain specimens both oi the lawe
and citha charters in question, and even collectione
oi statutas to which its application is not altogether
obvious On the whole the idea prevalent in the minds
oi legal antiquariae of the fourteenth century seems
to have been that the continuity of English institu-
tions justified the insertion oi this table in any
law collection Hence by degrees the glossary became
still further differentiated, one form, Sat and Sole, being
most in favour for academie purposes, and another,
Mocbrceba for the practieal exposition of current terma
in official and municipe] privileges, whilst still another
form was used also in the shape of a list beginning
with Averpeey.
