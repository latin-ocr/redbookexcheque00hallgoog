ccxcvi raasson.

The above view of the Constitution oi the Housc-
hold in the twelfth centuryis supplemented by the very
interesting and instructive notices contained in the
Order of the Coronation oi Queen Eleanor, printed in
a previous volume.1 In this document we are pre·
sented with another view of the Household, hemely,
the feudal constitution wherein the great officere of

· - State and those of the Hall and Chamber alike appear

as a body of earls and knights and serjeants, who
essert and vindicate their tenores ol office by proliers
of service ‘¹ jure hereditario? That these services
were not merely an empty honour is abundantly
proved by the numerous contemporary tenuras of
land recorded in the Tasta de Nevitl and elsewhere
as appertaining to many such offices, whilst later still,
es we have seen,2 the whole Household was marshalled
in strict order oi precedcnce according to the rules of
chivalry. But apert from the seudal and chivalrous
complexion of these interesting proceedings, we can
obtain a good deal· of information respecting the extent
of the establishment itself‚ which may be advan-
tageously compared with the Constitution oi 1135.
Perhaps the chief point of interest is to be found
in the largely incrcesed importance of the great officere
of State, especially the Butler, the Marshal‚ and the

ieri and Dispensatores of an earlier age has now become
concontrated in the office of the Lord Steward, whose
supreme authority over tha menial side of the House-
hold is well expressed elsewhere in the contemporary
definition of the services of a eoolr whose serjeanty
required hia attendance on the day of the King’s
coronation “ ad laciendum quod Senescallus praci-
peret.’'⁸
