Rstreats are so long detained before that they arc de-
livered at the said Exchequer, thet the King has received
hereby, for many causes, great damage. And in the time
of his father it was ordained, among other things, that
Justiccs and InquisitorS, whosoever they might be, and
others who had Estreats to deliver at the Exchequer
should deliver thern from year to year at Michaelmaa
And J ustices in Eyre [deliver] forthwith their Estreats oi
the same Eyrc as soon as they should have ended it; let
this ordinance he from henccforth observed. And for-
asmuch as it pertains to the Offlce of the Treasnrer of the
said Exchequer who now is, or for the time being, to re-
ceive all the Estreats delivered there, and so soon as he
shall have received them, to provide that summonses be
made from them to the Sheriffs as is meet, and sundry
kinds of J astices have been and still are assigned through-
out the land es'well to hear and determine divers matters,
aa to take Assizes and Attaints, to deliver gaols, and to
perform and conclude other matters, more than was wont
to be donc3 it is a necessary thing for the King's service
that the said Treesurer henceforth should know every
year, at the end of the year, who have delivered Estreats
and who have not, and how many and who ought to
have delivered Estreats.

And ior this purpose let the Olerk of the Rolls of the
Ohancery, who is, or for the time shall be, cause hence-
forth to be written in the Estreat of the Chaucery,
which he shall cause to be delivered at the end of ihe
year attha Exchequer, the names of all those who in
that year for which he delivers Estreats shall have been
assigned by Commission from out of the Chancery to

hear, inquire, or do any matter for which fine, amercia-
ment‚ or other profit pertaining to the King might by
chance or ought to arise. And let the said Treasurer
give heed hereto, that the King be served in his Estreats

in all that he ought.
