u ie in· Of the historical velus cf the collection of public Acts
⁸ ²¹¹ ' entered in this Book something has been said in a

former volume.¹ Amongst these instrumente the texts
of the well-known Angla-Nomen lawe, institutes, and
charters of liberties, would seem to claim a special
notice, yet not only would any adequate description of
cheir manuscript relations occupy every considerable
space, but this task practically comes within the scope
of the work which hae been commenced‘ with such
profound learning and research by Dr. ussermann*
The Editor, therefore, has thought it more becoming to
confine any attempts for the elucidaticn of these
relations to a brief enumeration of the several MSS. in
the 'l'able of Contents.³

The Red Book funrishes the texts Sc 1 and Sc. 2 of

Νξ ζ, five famous ordinances of William I. and Henry Ι.
ers. These texts are totally distinct, Sc 1, which isderived

from the Quadripertitce, comprieing only a text of the
Ooronation Charter of Henry I., which isincorporated
in the Laws of Henry 1.‚⁴ just as a second copy of the
London Chartsr of Henry II. ie similarly preserved in the
related Cotton MS„ formerly part of the Liber Oresteion·
ram of the Guildhall⁵ From Set was derived a purely
official collection, namely, the text now known se K. 3,
the later insertione of some fifteenth century scribe in the
Gnildhall Me. above mentioned.l Another point of especinl
interest in connection with the Exchequer text is that
the existence in the Hic hadamar Articles of William Ι.
of certain interpolated articles, in a hand of about the
year 1230, sufficiently disproves the theory that these and
other interpolatione in the Anglo·N0rmen lawe and char-
ters were the work of courtly scribes in search of evidence
