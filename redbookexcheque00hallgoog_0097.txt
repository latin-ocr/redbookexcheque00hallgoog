only two constitutional documents relating to Ireland Irelffl‘l
are entered in the Red Book as it is now preserved to l
uss,1 it is et least possible that three important ³
Charters relating to the family ol Lacy, which have
been transcribed in the Hargrave manuscript, may
possibly have been included in the original exemplar.

A few words have still to be said with regurd to eonstitu-
several constitutional documents of a more miscellaneons ἷζξῗ
nature. of these, perhaps, the most important are the ments.
well-known Ordinence establishing the rates of the great
(lustom of wool, Wool-fells and Leather in the year
1275,l the charter to the wine merchants oi Gasoony in
connection with the issue of Cocta buccatorta in 1303,8
and the provisions of the Jewry in 1266.⁴ In the cnse oi
the last two of these instrumente the text of the Red
Book is of especiel authority and velue, and the same
remark will apply to the Ordinances which decreo an
amnesty for the murderers and adherente respectively
oi Piers Gavestonl and Thomas of umescere and the
Ordinances regulating Leep year⁷ and the Terms of
courir There ere also entered here original reports of
several cases, most oi which were heard before the King
and Council, including the disputo oi the Bishop of
Herelord with the citizens oi Hereford in 1227, which
was entered here by, or at the direction ol, Alexander de
Swereford himself,⁹ the remarkable case oi the serjeanty
of Bartholomew de Cheyne,¹⁰ the cese of the inheritance
of Isabella de Fortibus previously referred to,¹¹ and the
