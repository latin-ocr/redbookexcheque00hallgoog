the shires have been subjected to extensive changes,
end where whole hundreda have disappeared, it is
not to be wondered if the vill or maner has often
dwindled into a more or less obscure landrnark. Even
where the ecclesiastical parish affords surer means of
recognition, we have to reokon with the persistent redu-
