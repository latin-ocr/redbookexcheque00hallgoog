Watrhman ld. The Tmesurer's (llerk was only paid
during the reoess and then attha rate of Sd. per diem.

The equally modest salariae and allowances of thedigni-
fied officers of tha upper Exohequer for an earlier period
will he found set forth in the Oocaatituto'o Demos Recio,
and less distinotly in the Issus Rolls and Liberata Rolls
and Wardrobe Aooounts of the thirteenth century. The
rest of the staff ware paid on asupplementery account

Following the collection oi precedente connected with axene-
the privileges and liabilities of the ministare (though not ffiigffl'
in the actual order of entry in the Red Book of the
Exchequer as it now existe) we meet next with certain
official regulations and tabulated forms which possess
little more than an antiquarian interest. Amongst these
may be mentioned the regulations in respect ol sees for
inspecting recorda or for making office copies;¹ the
standard weight of wax and tha proportione of the same
allowed for tho sealing of write 3² the scale ol payment in
foros for the delivery of these same writs3³ the com·

mnted velue of a hawk according to the season‚⁴ the
principle of which commutation seems to have beon
horrowed from the Diolopcas ;5 and an ordor for the
publio examination oi official weights and measures.⁶
There is also a curione scale of diets or deily weges
and allowanoee ior the service of the write and
summonses of the Ooort according as the Exohequer
happened to be fixed atWestminster or at York.⁷ In each
cese, it will he observed, the service ior the Western
counties ramained unaffeoted, although the Exchequer
was removed to Shrewsbury on a memorable occasion.
Still more interesting is the table of days assigned to
the Sheriffs of the respective eounties sor concluding their

“ accounts,⁸ a point which has before this given rise to
considerable speculation.
