when the earlier sheets had, perfores, been long sines
printed off. When it is borne in mind that the first sheet
of this edition had been printed off, 'that is bosey,
practically published‚ nearly five years before the last
sheet was completed, it will be evident that the Editor
could scarcely trusttoredeem the u'tter hopelessness of his
task by a mere list of Emito, or by an Analytical Index.

It only remmus for the Editor to acknowledge with a
deep sense of gratitude the kindlyassistance of many
ekilful and willing hands.

The fttality through which the present enterprise was
deprived in rapid succession oi the services of two
editore, both specialists in genealogieal studies, oould not
fail to cast a heavy senesci responsibility upon one to
whom the care nithe fiscal department of the work hed
been chiefly assigned. The death of Mr. Walford Selby,
with whose name the publication of the Red Book of
the¹ Excheqner was first associated, has been widely
deplored, but the retirement, through ill benith, oi
ΜΓ. J. H. Round‚ perhaps the one English scholar capable
of doing full justice to the genealogical portion of the Ma,
was an irreparable loss to the scheme of this edition. The
Editor is under many obligations to this former colleague
for his unceasing interest in the progress of the work,
and for invaluable corrections and suggestions offered
by him in the preparation of the Index

There can be few English studente of mediceval his·
torical manuscripts in the present day who have not
been indebted to Dr. F. Liebermann sor valuable assis·
tance. Those who are acquainted with the nature of
Dr. Liebermann's work upon the text of the English
laws will easily imagine the assistance which he could
render for the classifioation ol the parallel manuscripts
of tho Anglo·Norman lawe and chortem contained in
the Red Book. s
