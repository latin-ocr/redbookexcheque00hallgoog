but attho same time we may reasonably conjecture
that the constitution of the King's House was, at
least, as fully developed in this country before the
accession of Hemy Π., as it was in Normandy. It may
even be doubted whether the ambulatory household of
the Anglo-Norman kings hada separate establishment
for both countries. The fact, however, remains, that no
documentary evidence of the earlier English establish-
ment has survived, but it is not on that account to be
insisted that no English establishment whatever existed
before the reign of Henry ΙΙΙ., in which the earliest
records of the Wardrobe and Household are dated A
careful study of the constatura Dounon Rept's in the
Enchequer MSS. will enable us to realise the remarkable
circumstance that the establishment set forth there is
no mere isolated list, but is a oarefully conceived and
permanent organisation, which must have existed for
many years before the close of the reign of Henry I.,
and wbioh was continued on practioally the same plan
for nearly 600 years after his grandson's death. That is
to say, that it is possible to identify the classification of
the members of the royal household in the year 1130
with that which obtained, with some additions, it is
true, down to the year01'782.

The Constitution of the King’s House in Normandy Theman
about the year 1135, as it is represented in the Red ffsslffgsst
Book andin the Black Book of the Exohequer, may bo
classified from the analogy of the later establishment of
the royal household in Plantagenet times somewhat as
