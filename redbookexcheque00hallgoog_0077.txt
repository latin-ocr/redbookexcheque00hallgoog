' Not only has this compilation been neglected by modern
writers, but no copies seem to have been made of it by
o›ntemp0rary scribes This, as in the case of the Dialogus
itself, was doubtless owing to its purely official character,¹
and a curicus confirmation of this theory is afforded by
the fact that in the case of each of these two treatiscs the “
only early copies that exist outside the Exchequer texts
are contained in transcripts which were undoubtedly
made from an official source² Unlike the Dialogus de
doctmonte, the Mint trectise has raroly been transcribed
by the antiquar-ies of the sixteenth and serenteenth
centurias A perfect copy is, however, preserved in
MS. Lansdown 171, with the title, “De monetae assio,
“ allio, et examinatione, incerti auctoris ”3 but although
this professes to bc a transcript from the Exchequer
Register,· it has, in reality, been derived from the
Cotton MS.

There are several ways by which this beatiss may Its history·
have come into the Red Book of the Exchequer. In the
first place it may have boen communicated officially to
the Barons‚ or at least recognized in official quarters as a
standard authority on a subject which nearly concerned
the business ci the Oourt Again, it may heve been
transcribed through the enterprise or curiosity of a
private clerk, without obtaining any official recognition
This point, however, is of small importonce, especially
since it does not assist to determine the date and
authorship oi the treatise, which depend upon internal ' ,
evidence alone.
