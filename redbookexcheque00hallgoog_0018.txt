ileu ⁰⁰¹1· The second question rs whether this establishment‚
ffiffle Norman and English, 1s to be regarded as a develop-

ment during the first hali of the twelith century of
‘⁰02⁰' the Anglo· Norman Household of the eleventh centuryl

This question rs not easily answercd‚ because the Gon-
stitution of 1135 is a document absolutely unique in the
historicel literature 01 the period. We may, however, at
least point 10 two facts of considerable significance,
namely, that the Constitution in question can bo proved
to resemble, in almost every particular, that characteristic
estahlishment 01 the Royal Household, which endured
with little change till the end oi the last century; while
such isolated and indistinct notices as ‘we possess con-
cerniug the earlier Household seem to agree substantially
with the scale of this Constitution. The precise notices
v of Household offices met with in the Pipe Roll of 1130
have already been referred to. Even in Domesday Book
itseli we find the greater number of these africes dis-
tinctly mentioued, and we can scarcely doubt that
they were practicelly identioal with the establishmont
which had 0000111011 its modern form only one genera·
tion later.
rvi ³ The solution of the third question that anses here is
3,, 10 some extent anticipated hythe preceding argument.
.· Whether the Constituticn of 1135 is iderrtical with, or
at least nearly related 10, the establishment of the Royal
Household in the thirteenth century, is easily decided by
a comparison with the ample stetistics that exist for the
later period, aud this comparison alfords some highly
interesting results. In the reign of Edward Ι, the
Household had attained 0 very high degree of organi·
aetion, and yet we find that it differs in very few
particulare from thet of* Henry I. Here we heve
the same departmental arrangement, but the dis·
tinction between the 1101100, 01 Hall, and the Chambcr
is still more clearly marked. In the former the menial
officere arc similarly grouped according to their several
