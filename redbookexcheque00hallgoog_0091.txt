further instalment of tha Calendar or from the examina-
tioufrom an ample selection from the remaining originals
themselves, We must, therefore, accept the conclusion·
that these deeris have either been preserved together in an
unsuspeoted quanter or else that they have not survived.

’ Itbas been previously observedl th'at this portion os κομι
the Gartulary contains a series of documenta or evi-31:2¹3& ·
denses of the King's title to certain possessione, but it is
not very clear on what principle the selection of these
instrumente for registration in the Exchequer Register
was made. It is evidcnt that they form a very small
proportion of the whole number enrolled in the Closs
aud Patent Rolls, in tha Plea Rolls and Feet of Fines,
and even in the Pipa and Memoranda Rolls of the
Exchequer and the Liber A and Liber B of the same
Gourt. Astera careful consideration of this [soblem it
'ss believed that its probable solution will be foundin the
connection of these daeds . with official business or
interests, that is to say, they were executed either by
ministers oi the Crown or by its private debtors. In
one aspect, therefore, these transactione may be viewed
in the light of the forfaiture of an official recognizance
(illustrating the anti-feudal policy of the Orown), and in
another aspect in that of the liubility of accountants
which is so explicitly stated in the Dictoyos. Since it
has not been found possible to give the text of the
whole serias of these interesting deeds in the peges of
the present edition of the Red Book of the Exchequer‚ a
short prtcc's of thecontents of each has been given in the
Table of Contenta. Seven documents which relate to
the case of Isabella de Fortibus, Corrntess of Albemarle‚
have, however, been printed u'rt ecwmso on account of
their close connection with the story of Adam dc
Stratton’srise and fall as related in the preceding pages3
but there is perhaps scarcely one document in the whole
collection that is not associated with the darker side of
the Edwardian statecratt
