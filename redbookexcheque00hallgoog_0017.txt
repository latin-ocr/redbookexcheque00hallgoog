The above clessilieetion of the establishment of the we· uie
King's House et the end of the reign of Henry
suggests three very importent questions, unse, was mano
this establishment restricted to the Normen Duchy,
or vves it tthe counterpert of the Domus Repis m
Englend? It hes been previously shown thet most

ΙΕεῑεὴΙίΝεΙιὲυ

English?

historiens heve completely overlooked the distinct
references to Normendy which occur in the body of the
document, while on the other hend it mey be objected
to the nsrrower view of the applicetion cl this
document to Normnndy elene, thet the neerly eon-
tempurery Pipe Roll of 1130 not only effords ample
evidence of the existence ol e similer esteblishment
in Englend, but by mention ol the names ol the
individuul officere, it certainly implies thet they oecu-
pied precisely the seme positione et the English Oourt.
It would perhapsbe possible to supply from this Pipe
Roll the names of almost every one ol the officere
whose titles end duties ere set out in the Normen
establishment end even to supplement the letter in
several importent particulare. We ere perhups justi-
fied therefore in regerding this constitution es the
normal establishment of the Domus Βορέα, which
follows the King's person, like the Ourie itself, with
comperetive ease, thenks to en cmple provision of
ccrts end sempter horses end to the simplieity even
ol royel house-keeping in the twcllth century.
