We have interesting notices also of the departments ofc nunu musy
the Almonry and of the Napery, but it will be evidenti} mon ,⁸55

that not only are certain offices which were immediately
conoerned with these festivities described ιιι greater
detail than the rest, but that several purely honorary
offices are mentioned which cannot be regarded as part
of the normal establishment of the Household at all,
being claimed and exereised “jure haereditario ” on the
analogy of the great offices of State. These honorary
offices, which undoubtedly were exercised from a very
early period, reappear at every succeeding coronation.¹
In still later times, however, the documentary evidence
connected with these pageants enables us to ascertain
the complete state of the establishment of the Royal
Household with greater precision than can be ensured by
any other means. In the narrative before us we have
merely a reference ιο the constitution oi 1135 for a list
oi the minor offioes with their emolumenta,2 but in the
Coronation Books of 'Pudor and Stuart sovereigns, every
member of the Household, from the highest to the
lowest, appears in receipt of some special allowance for
the οοιιιίοιι.3
Several interesting points arise hom a considerat tron Di neu nna

of the texts oi the two treatises. In the Oonst ιιιιοιιο ⁰f²¹¹⁰i²¹l
itself much difficulty has been experienced m the
rendering of certain archaia termsand formulae. A very
good instance will be found in the case oi the abbrevia·
tion θοι, which occurs in connection with a certain kind
of simnel. We should naturally expect this word ιο
be derived from the same source as themora medem
‘salary,’' particularly as we find the simnel in question
connected with the issue oi ratione from the Dispensary.
