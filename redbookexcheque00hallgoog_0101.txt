yearsareally scientific system of Record Indexing had
been introduced in connection with the new series of
mediaeval Calendars produced under the supervision of
the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records3 aud now that
aprecedent existed, the Editor conceived that it was his
duty to rernodel his Index on the newest lines. This
undertaking delayed the publication of the work for
another two years Moreover, the task presented almost
anparalleled difficulties arising from the unexampled
comuptness of the text. That it was an uncongenial task,
and one for which the Editor possessed few qualifications,
were obstacles that might not be avoided. A body of
Record scholare and topographers, prodigal of labour,
and keeping pace with the development of the text,
might hope to produce a sufficient Index to a Feodery of
the Thirteenth (lentury. Unfortnnatelyâ€š however, the
lubour involved in unravelling the manuscript relations
of the 300 manuscript pisces which the Red Book con-
tains entirely presented any systematic and progressive
identification of the personal and place-names of the
text In other words, the work of writing the Preface

may fairly be hoped, however, that the purely voluntary
labour expended upon the present Index will render it
more serviceeble than some of the earlier ones that have
been referred to. Personal names have been grouped
together wherever there was a reasonable prospect of
identification, and the numerous variants have been
indicated by means of cross references. The result,
though far from complete or satisfactory, i's highly

instructive, aud not a little diverting. Aglance at the
twenty variants oi suche name as De Ohaorciis, will show
the eutwsrd dissimilarity of even the best marked forms.
It is far different in the case of a confused personality,
the name, for instance, of Iovel, which,with its variantsof

Luverez, Veres, huvel, Luel, suggestsacombination of two
