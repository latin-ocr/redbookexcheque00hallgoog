The story of· Adam de Stratton's crime and its punish· Thclcgeno
ment as given here are as follows t-In the year 1289, ἕξέῗζῗ
and apparently soon after the King’s return from ahroad ton.
in the month of August, Adam, or Sir Adam, de Stratton
or Stratteford, who is variously described as a clerk or
Boron of the Exchequer, was arrested and convicted
before the King's Justices at the Tower of homicide,
forgery of reeords, peculation‚ soroery, and other
trespasses and enormities. This Adam, we read, had a
bad character. He was eovetous and avarioious, past
belief; aforger of seals, and tainted with many forms of
crime. In his treasure house was found a vast pile of
ill-gotten wealth, estimated according to different
accounts, at from 30,000 to 50,000 maros. It was
noticed that much of this was in the old coinage, and
there were also jewels and erowns of gold¹ In addition
to this the value of his lands and of the houses which
he had built for himself at Westminster, raised the total
valuc of his forfeited estates to 50,000l., without in·
eluding the value of his spiritualities. Amongst his
possessions was found a certain bag of silk containing
parings of hails, and human hair, the feet of toads and
moles, and other diabolico. This bag was seiaed hy the
examining Justice and officially scaled, but Adam, in
contempt of the King's majesty, tampered with the seal
and threw the incriminating articles into a drain. For
this contempt he was convicted before the Justioes of
treason and soroery. His life was spared by reason
of his olergy‚ but all his lands and goods were
forfeited to the Orown, and he left the court covered
with shams. Others, however, state that he was
imprisoned during the King's pleasure. In any ease
both the crime and its punishment were of a prodigious
docear, because the moon at her full appeared to be
striped with Indian red and other oolours.
