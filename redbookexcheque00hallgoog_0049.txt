Among the aocused was Adam de Stratton, but here charges
he no longer figures aa a base adventurer, a sordid ffffld,
usurer, and a contemptible charlatan. The charges stratton.
preferred by his enemies and victims, and the defenee
offered in his own words, reveal his character in quite
another light. We see the cautious and plausible
lawyer‚ the courtly and dignified Canon, consounding his
accusare out of their own mouths, and winning case aster

he entices a rich and devout widow to his house and
