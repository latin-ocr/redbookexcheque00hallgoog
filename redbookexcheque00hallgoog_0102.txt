branehes of vcnsry in one famous serjeantry.² Apart
from these laborious attempta at concontration‚ persenal
names have been given in the Index in their literal
form. Anoticeable feature ol this Index is an attempt
to economise space in such a vast undertaking by a
systeruatic abbreviation os the most common Christian
nemeae plan which hes the additional advantage of
avoiding the unsightlyjuxtaposition ol English Christian
names and Latin or French sumamea Another innova·
tion will be found iu the reference to persons exer·
cising any office or employment or designated by
· some patronymic, or hya mers nickname, under their
Christian names. This plan, if nottho most convenient,
is, at least, the only one that appears logical, though at
the present moment it cannot be employed in every
instance. 'l'hese official titles, together with the usual
subjecte of an Index Rerum, have been distinguished in
this Index by smallcapitals.

Plane-names have also been thrown together os lar aa
practiccble, and they have been modsrnized in italic
type, but not identified in the usual manner. In the
case oi such acorrupt text a complete identification oi
these place-names, that is to say, of the actual manor,
farm, or other portion of the modern vill referred te,
would not only have occupied undue opacabat would
have involved a reconstruction of the feudal tenanciee in
thirty counties of England, which very few scholars have
even partially attempted in any one. It is true that
other manuscript lists of these tenancies exist, but they
are for the most part ol later date. The identification

of the thirteenth century and fifteenth century forms

purer forms cl place-names in Domcsday Book, and
in the twelfth century‘ Chartere ond Pipe Rolls, have

in the thirteenth century Feodaries become altered
