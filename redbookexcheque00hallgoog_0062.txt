The still lerger end ier more important collection
of writs, statutos end ordinences connected with the
government oi the Exchequer-its interncl economy
end its relations to the Orown end to the subjecte-
forms one of the most characteristic portione oi the
register. strange to ssy, however, the authoritative
versione of the Stctutes oi the Reelm which msy be
found here bevenot been used in the printed editions
to thesemo extent es certain of the historicel documents
which heve a much slighter velue. N eturelly we heve
to distinguish between the cncctments chet ere en·
tered here ss possessing n general interest (just ss the
earlier oonipilers ol the Register entered the Anglo-
Norman lewe end ordinantes which heve no special
reference to the Exchequer itself) end the instrumente
which directly affected its stete or governnnce. Under
the former head may be included copies of Mcgns
Ocrtc¹ end of the Sententia taran the Stctutes of
Merlberg,³ westminster* end de Ripensis,⁶ the provision
respecting Leep Year⁶ end the regulation oi the Ancient
Custom on wool,⁷ together with the idemnity for the
murder ol Piers cheston.⁸ Under the letter heed
severcl well-known statutes msy be enumerated,
especially those of York,‘³ Lincoln ¹⁰ end Rhuddlen,¹¹
while there cre also enumher oi write end ordinnnces
ol less note but considerable interest, ell oi which
directly relate to Exchequer business.

Amongst these moy be mentioned in order of dcte
the dcys assigned for plecding et the Enchequer

(52 Hen. ΙΙΙ.),12 the provisions ol the Judeism
