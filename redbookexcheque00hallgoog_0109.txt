entry in the Red Book. Again, we meet, in the return
ol a Sussex barony, with a Hurste de warbersone, when
the true reading should have been “ waleranus de Hurste,
Willelmus de Warbertone.'’ The curicus form of a York-

curicusly enough ‘Gervase de Sparkforde held there oi

the honour of Bologne, in Esses. At page cclxxx we
read of the “Exercitus de Sparle.’' This in connection
