lo support the imperial poliey of Edward I.‚l regerdless of
the fact that similar evidence bed been carefully pre-
served during a whole preceding century. 'l'his over-
sigbt was indeed all the more remarkable, inasmuch
as Mr. Hunter had assigned a correct date to the Red

polations in a collection of Iondou laws ond charters
