Non, this army of Spnrle should heve taken its neme
from some objective point of the campaign like the
“Exercitus de Ruelent'’ mentioned in the sente eonnec-
tion‚ hut we seek in vein ior any such plene-neme in the
Welsh Merches. We may notice, however, thet the re·
turns of these militm-y levies were mede in connection
with the Norfolk feee of the Esrl of Arundel, whose Sussex
tenente would be, end indeed were, subject to similer
lisbilities, “ud servandae marchias wallis? This gives
us s possible relationship between the military duties of
the Noriolk und Sussex serjeents‚ so thet we may
reesonebly conjecture thet this “Exercitus de Spsrle”
was s muster for the Welsh war st Sporle, in Noriolk.
On the seme showing we might not unreueonubly con·
jecture thet the Sussex serjeentry was performed by
service st some muster et Spixworth, in Norfolk (the
Spikefuurds of Domesdey)‚ or et least thet Sperch Ford
o member of the csstleof Corphum in the Welsh merches,
is indicated. Indeed, when we remember the feudel
relationship between the Arundel fees in Norfollr end
Sussex, end their peculinr position in connection with
the werd, doe, of the South and Eest coest end of the
· Westem borders‚ it might seem that we heve here the
explanation of the difficulty. To meet obvious objections ⁸
it should be remembered thet serjeentries were elsewhere
required outside of the “ Serjeunt’s ”own munty, like the
Burnel serjesntry in Shropshire, where the tenent must
journey to Essex to trein the King’s hawlrs “apud
Subinges,” whilst another banner serjesntry in Oxford·
shire rnight be required “ infre quatuor portus Angliae.”
Why the Suseex serjeents should be mustered in
Norfollr‚ or how the Norfolk tenente could be trans·
ported to Weles are questions beyond the limite of the
present inquiry; but that the propositionis not wholly
, en entrevsgunt one appears from the historicsl instance
