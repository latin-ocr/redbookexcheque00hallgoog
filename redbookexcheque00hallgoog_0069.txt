charges So the establishment oi the Exehequer
received ite first considerable enlargement since the
reign of Henry ΙΙ.1

Having seton foot the above extensive reforms in the le Oroi-
economy and administration ol the Enchequer itself, the 322⁰ng
Council proeeeded in the following year to extend the ‘helm-
same ιο ιιο great spending departments, namely, ιο the Μ
Wardrobe and to the subordinate departments cl the
Household. It will ιο seen that the intention of these
further Ordinanees is ιο ensure the due collection and
audit of the royal revenue, as well as ιο put an end ιο
ιιο more glaring evils of purveyanee. For this purpose
it ie provided that the several heads of departments‚ the
Keeper ol the Wardrohe‚ the Butler, the offieers of the
stud, and all amheasadors and messengers, are ιο receive
the money' required for the usual expensos ol the royal
service at the Exohequer, and are also ιο account there
for what they have disbnrsed. At the same time all
menies derived lrom fines, fees, end purveyanoe are ιο
ιο paid into the Exchequer and strictly aooounted for.
The importanee of these Ordinences can be estimated
irem the preveiling disceptent, especially in the citiee,
in respect of exaotions like prieage and pre-emption3 a
disoootent which found violent expression in the London
riots ol 1326. They may be regarded, therefore, as
supplementing the reformo of the preceding year io the
administration of the main branchcs ef the revenue,
with the similar object of sllaying the popular discontent
which the conduct oi the Household officere had exeited
in an even more marked degree than that oi the Ex-
ohequer ministers and aeoountants.

immediately beneficial to the stete of the royal finances,
