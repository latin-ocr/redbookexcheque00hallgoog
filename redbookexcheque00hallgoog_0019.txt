employments in the kitchen bakery, larder‚ pantrv,
and elsewhere, under the control of the seward, aad in
the buttery under thst of the Butler3 hut the depart-
ments of the Scullery‚Ohandry, Poultry, and Salsary,
have been differentiated, and carters and snmptermen
attached to each department have apparently been
relegated 10 the Stables within the jurisdiction of the
hlarshal. Moreover each department now contains an
appropriate and well ordered staff of clerks, serjeants
yeomen, and grooms. In the Chamber the Chamher·
lain presides over the domestic, and the Marshal and
Constable over the forinsec officere ln eschol these ,

natmslly been made, bnt they ere iewsr than we should
have expected, and from this time onwards the plan of
the establishment cf the Household remains practically
unaltered down 10 the Act oi 1782. It is true that in
later times the Household was expauded almost beyond
recognition, but this expansior followed the lines of the
original classification. The “water-canier” of Domes-
day Book and of tha constitution of 1135 had become in
1307 the Serjeant of the Bath, with ayeoman attondant
at his disposal. After the Restoration‚ this officer
appears as the “ Bagnio man‚” with a greatly enhanced
importance. In the modern Household his daties are
probably discharged by an ordinary laoquey.

This office is merely a type of the simple process
of expansior, which attained 1ο an unwieldy bulk
under the later Stuarts, and entered upon. an era
oi rapid decline alter the Revolution. From firstoto
last the constitution oi the King's House remained in
theory the same, and we must not be tempted from a
casual inspeetion 10 make many et the expense of the
“amusing disorder” which seems 10 characterizs its
primitive establiahmentl
