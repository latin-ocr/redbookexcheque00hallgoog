His ior-th

cccxxii sarraca

The criminal proceedings against him on the prose·

u thcution of the Abbot of Quarrt took place' m Easter
Omer- Tarm of this earne year, and the Record informa us that

hewse convicted by a jury of having mut tilated the
seal of a charter granted by the Oountess ol Albemarle
to the Abbey in order to support the ease of his
patroness. The Oourt ordered the cliarter to be im-
pounded and inrolled for better security, and Adam de
Stratton was committed ιο gaol¹

Immediately after this unfortunate reverse Adam de
Stratton seems ιο have devoted himself mainly to the
improvement of his private property without venturing
upon anyinrportunt tranaactions.2 Before long, however,
his old propensities re-asserted themselves, leading
alowly hut surely to his ruin

We can gain some idea of the general nature of the
malpractices alleged against him by a careful examina-
tion os the evidence adduced during the sensational
trials of the year 1289-90, and we can form our own
conclusione therefrom astar this lapse of time in a spirit
of the utmost impartiality.

We have first, however, ιο deal with the evidence os
the Chroniclers—that is to say, of contemporary
historiens who obtained their informatiou as ιο official
or judicial events mainly from popular rumour. In the
present case these garbled versione of proceedings with
the truth of which we are now acquainted on the most
unimpeachable authority, are rather amusing.³
